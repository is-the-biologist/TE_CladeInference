# TE Haplotype Inference:

The included Python and R scripts are used to infer TE haplotypes from copy number data as detailed in [publication]. Detailed Jupyter notebooks as well as Rmarkdown files will walk you through implementing the modules, but this README will include brief overview of usage of the packages. 

These scripts take in processed copy number data in the form of numpy matrices and tsvs.
